A modern online store for purchasing outdoor clothing

## Description
RainyDays is a demo website for an outdoor clothing store, built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website pulls product items from an API to display them dynamically. 
-	The project originally included automated background removal for the product images, but due to API call restrictions, this feature is currently not active, resulting in the white background for each of the products. This feature would of course be included if the site was to be deployed for professional use.

## Features
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Fetches product data from an API
- Aesthetically pleasing and modern user interface
- Filter and sort mechanisms for products
-  Persistent Gender Filtering: The website remembers the user's selected gender (e.g., men's or women's clothing) and maintains this preference across different pages. This ensures a seamless browsing experience, as users do not have to reselect their gender preferences when navigating through the site.
- Search feature not included due to time restrictions

## Built With
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Frameworks were intentionally not utilized in order to showcase ability to build entirely from scratch
